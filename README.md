# LRS-xApi
Learning Record Store, Experience API compliant
https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec

The project is discontinued as I got a new job and have other priorities to focus on. 
It's build in ASP.NET Web api 2. 
The project is very close to finish. The xApi specification requires 8 services (API endpoints) also called as Resourdces by the xApi spec.
1. Documents Resources
2. State Resource
3. Agents Resource
4. Activities Resource
5. Agent Profile Resource
6. Activity Profile Resource
7. About Resource
8. Statements Resource

The only one that it's missing from this project is the Statements Resource which is the most complex one. The other ones are fully implement and fully working according to the specification.
